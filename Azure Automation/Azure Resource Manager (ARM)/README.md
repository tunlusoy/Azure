# Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

## What Is It

Azure Resource Manager lets you deploy, update or delete resources for your cloud solution in a single, coordinated operation. Resources can include virtual machines, storage accounts, virtual networks, services, or any component that you are managing.

## Why Use It

- You can deploy, manage, and monitor all of the resources for your solution as a group, known as a resource group, rather than handling these resources individually.
- You can repeatedly deploy your solution throughout the development life-cycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
- You can use declarative templates to define your deployment.
- You can define the dependencies between resources so they are deployed in the correct order.
- You can apply access control to all services in your resource group because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.
- You can apply tags to resources to logically organize all of the resources in your subscription.
- You can clarify billing for your organization by viewing the rolled-up costs for the entire group or for a group of resources sharing the same tag.
